During my PhD at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), I served as a teaching assistant for **MATH 1853 - Linear Algebra** for two consecutive academic years and was honored to receive the **Best Teaching Assistant Award**. This experience made me realize that I have a talent for communicating with others and a genuine passion for explaining complex concepts in an accessible way.
