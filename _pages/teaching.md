During my PhD at The University of Hong Kong (HKU), I served as a teaching assistant for **MATH 1853 - Linear Algebra** for two consecutive years, receiving the **Best Teaching Assistant Award**. I also assisted with **ELEC 2441 - Computer Organization and Microprocessors**. These experiences enhanced my ability to communicate complex technical concepts and fostered my passion for education and mentorship.
